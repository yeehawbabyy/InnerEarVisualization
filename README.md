# Inner Ear Visualization

This project is a Python-based tool for visualizing the inner ear. It uses data from [Open Anatomy](https://www.openanatomy.org/atlases/nac/inner-ear-2018-02.zip). 

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yeehawbabyy/InnerEarVisualization.git
    cd InnerEarVisualization
    ```

2. Download the necessary data files from [Open Anatomy](https://www.openanatomy.org/atlases/nac/inner-ear-2018-02.zip) and unpack them in the same folder as the Python script.

3. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Run the visualization script:
```bash
python main.py
```
